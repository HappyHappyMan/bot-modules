bot-modules
===========

A collection of modules I've created to interface with various web services and APIs for my irc bot. 

I've also included some of the original modules created by the pyfibot guys, though I'm reasonably sure a lot of them
don't work anymore. I figure it'll be good to have a backup somewhere, in case they become useful again.
